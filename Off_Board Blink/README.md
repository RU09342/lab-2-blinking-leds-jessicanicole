## Program Description
The code used in this part of the lab was the same code used for simple blink and multiple blink. Once the program is loaded onto the board, the M430G2553 chip was taken off the LaunchPad Developemnt Board and put into a non-solder breadboard. There were two ways the breadboard could be powered: 3.3Vcc from a power supply or run wires from your LaunchPad Developemnt Board Vcc pin to the breadboard (both ways require proper grounding as well).
